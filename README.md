***Incremental Improvements of Software Implemented RSA***

**Abstract**

During this project, we aim to implement the RSA algorithm using the C programming language, and measure the effect incremental improvements have on our implementation in terms of speed. The implementation speed will be measured using the UDOO development board. 

We will begin by implementing the RSA algorithm on the UDOO using C. To have a fully operational RSA implementation running on the UDOO will be the projects first main goal. When we have a satisfying implementation, we will measure the overall speed of the algorithm in its current state, using some set of predefined values. These measurements will be used as baseline measurements for the rest of the project. 

We will then incrementally make improvements to the base implementation, and measure what impact each improvement has in terms of speed. We will use the document "High-Speed RSA Implementation" as a starting point, and do a measurement after each successfully implemented improvement.
